# underemployment: A sociological investigation of underemployment and the lived experiences of underemployed workers

Increasing numbers of workers are underemployed: working below their potential or preference in terms of hours, wages and/or skills (HWS). This study will address, through a longitudinal mix-methods’ design, the knowledge gap that exists in what we know about underemployment levels, composition, predictors and outcomes and about the lived experiences of underemployed workers. The three main objectives are to: 
1.	Provide the first holistic, mixed-methods longitudinal picture of the lived experiences of underemployed workers across different case study locations, including:
    a.	within work - to explore how indicators of underemployment (HWS) and risk intersect and interrelate with industrial and employment relations and practices. 
    b.	outside of work - to explore the consequences of different types of underemployment for workers’ individual lives, social relationships, and civic engagement. 
2.	Contribute to theorising underemployment within the labour market continuum approach and as a nuanced multi-layered concept within contemporary working lives.
3.	Offer evidence-based recommendations to employers and policymakers, to address the impact of underemployment on social inequalities among individuals, families and communities.
